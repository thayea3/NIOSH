                    Shift work has been linked to poor sleep, chronic metabolic
                    disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
                    obesity), depression, and elevated risk for the occurrence
                    of accidents, especially when workersâ schedules involve
                    night and early morning shifts (1-5). These conditions can
                    worsen over time with the number of shifts worked per month,
                    and long-term exposure to nighttime shift work has long been
                    associated with increased risks for several forms of cancer
                    (6-8). Research conducted over the last 40 years has found a
                    strong link between health problems and disruption of the
                    human circadian system (9, 10), which regulates all of our
                    bodily functions, essentially telling our body to do the
                    right things at the right times.

                    In 2007, the World Health Organizationâs International
                    Agency for Research on Cancer declared âshift work that
                    involves circadian disruptionâ to be a probable carcinogen,
                    based on âlimited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity
                    of shift work that involves night workâ and âsufficient
                    evidence in experimental animalsâ that exposure to light
                    during their biological night is carcinogenic (11).

                    The effects are far-reaching, and extend well beyond the
                    healthcare sector. The most recent (2017â2018) statistics
                    for the U.S. labor force (12, 13) indicate that about 16%
                    (23.7 million) of all full-time wage and salaried employees
                    work evening/swing shifts (typically, 3â11 PM), night shifts
                    (11 PM to 7 AM), rotating shifts (alternating days,
                    evenings, and nights over successive work cycles), or other
                    schedules falling outside conventional daytime work hours (7
                    AM to 6 PM). About 20â30% of these workers are thought to
                    experience at least some symptoms of circadian disruption,
                    such as excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia (14).
                    Although more-recent data are not available from the US
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics (15) due to changes in
                    classifications, the proportion of shift-working nurses is
                    probably much higher that of shift worker in other sectors,
                    and research show that many nurses experience sleep problems
                    (see Sleep, accidents, and shift work).

                      shifts per week, but it is not unheard of for nurses to
                      work day-, night-, and mid-shifts in the same week (bottom

                    Sleep problems are common in healthcare workers, almost 50%
                    of whom sleep fewer than 7 hours per 24-hour cycle (34),
                    which places them among workers with the highest prevalence
                    of short sleep durations for all occupations (35). Recent
                    research examining shift-working nurses shows that day- and
                    evening-shift nurses experience more regular and consistent
                    restâactivity cycles compared to night-shift nurses (36).
                    Nurses showing greater sleep fragmentation and/or more
                    irregular restâactivity cycles also experienced poorer sleep
                    quality and lower daytime activity levels on workdays.

                    Poor sleep has consequences for health and emotional
                    well-being. A 2018 long-term study of healthcare shift
                    workers in four U.S. academic hospitals found that
                    participants who reported sleep disorders on a screening
                    questionnaire were almost twice as likely to experience
                    adverse safety outcomes over the following 6 months and
                    increased risk for anxiety or depression by almost
                    two-thirds (37).

                    Most of the available research examining specific
                    work-related injuries to nurses focuses on needle-stick and
                    musculoskeletal injuries, with a number of those studies
                    associating elevated risk for injury with shift work and
                    night shifts.

                      as with working evenings/nights and shifts longer than 13

                      associates worked two or more consecutive 12-hour shifts,
                      especially when those shifts involved nights, compared to

                      A 2015 survey of 1,744 newly licensed registered nurses
                      found that needle-stick injury risk increased 32% for
                      those working overtime and 16% for those working nights

                      Because many nurses are sleep-deprived during their work
                      week, the drive home after their shift can be particularly
                      hazardous. These data are supported by and the most recent
                      (2018â2019) Healthy Nurse Survey conducted by the American
                      Nurses Association, which reports that 14% of nurses
                      either nodded off or fell asleep while driving during the
                      past 30 days (34).

                      A landmark 1992 study of 635 Massachusetts nurses
                      published in the American Journal of Public Health showed
                      that, compared to those working either day shifts or
                      evening shifts only, rotating-shift workers were twice as
                      likely to fall asleep while driving home and experience
                      near-miss car accidents (41).

                      Nurses working night shifts are also more likely to have
                      difficulty staying awake while driving home compared to
                      nurses working other shifts (42, 43).

                      A 2013 study using objective (rest-activity, eye movement)
                      and subjective (questionnaires) assessments of nursesâ
                      drowsiness and their driving performance on a controlled
                      track following an 8â10-hour night shift found that the
                      participants were far more likely to experience a
                      hazardous driving event than on their drive to work before
                      the shift, especially if they had been awake for 16 hours
                      or more (44).

                      A more recent 2019 Australian study employing similar
                      methods confirmed this relationship between adverse
                      driving events and the drive home after the night shift,
                      finding that sleepiness-related events tended to occur
                      after the first shift and inattention-related events
                      tended to occur after subsequent shifts in the same cycle
                      (45).

                    <li>
                      The Australian study also found a connection between
                      adverse driving events, the timing of the nurses circadian
                      rhythms, and the time nurses had spent awake (45).

                    Regardless of shift worked, healthcare work in general
                    carries significant risk for work absences due to illness,

                      hospital workers still remain nearly twice as high as

                      Injuries among healthcare professionals occur at almost

                    Shift work is an inescapable fact of life in the 24-hour
                    operating environment of modern hospitals. To ensure
                    continuity of patient care (e.g. efficiency, fewer patient
                    handoffs) and accommodate nursesâ personal preferences
                    (e.g., shorter work week, improved work-life balance) (22,
                    23), nursing schedules typically follow 12-hour shifts that
                    can include working through the night (see graphic above),
                    when alertness levels are the lowest and the pressure for
                    sleep is the highest (see Sleep, accidents, and shift work).
                    Nursing therefore carries an inherent risk for disruption of
                    the circadian system, and nurses who work night shifts show
                    elevated health and occupational safety risks compared to
                    their colleagues who work days (24-26). It is reasonable to
                    infer that the greater the irregularity of work and sleep,
                    the greater the risk to health.

                      Health Study (27) beginning in 1976, mortality from all
                      causes (especially cardiovascular disease) increased
                      significantly among those working rotating shifts for 5
                      years or more compared to their colleagues who never
                      worked nights (25).

                      participants in the second Nursesâ Health Study II
                      (beginning in 1989) found elevated risk for breast cancer
                      among nurses who had worked rotating shifts for 20 years
                      or more (28), as supported by other studies (29).

                      Generally, elevated risk for breast cancer is greatest
                      among nurses who work night shifts (8), especially among
                      those who have been exposed to rotating night-shift work
                      at a younger age (28).

                    <li>
                      Some recent research has cast doubt on claims of an
                      association between working night shifts and breast
                      cancer, however, so continued investigation has been
                      recommended (30-32).

                      The risks are not limited to physical health. Nurses
                      working longer shifts (i.e., >10 hours) are up to 2.5Ã
                      more likely to experience burnout (i.e., emotional
                      exhaustion, depersonalization of patients, lack of
                      vitality) and job dissatisfaction compared to nurses
                      working shorter shifts (33). Working shifts longer than 13
                      hours is associated with decreased well-being, increased
                      job turnover, and greater patient dissatisfaction (33).

                    Light is not just for vision. While it has always been
                    essential for seeing the world around us, light has also
                    played a crucial role in our evolutionary adaptation to the
                    natural 24-hour environment created by Earthâs rotation.
                    With a few exceptions, most living things (including plants,
                    insects, and even microbes) cycle through internal or
                    endogenous biological rhythms that repeat daily. Called
                    circadian rhythms, they include all of our metabolic,
                    physiological, psychological, and behavioral processes.
                    Human circadian rhythms are synchronized by the pattern of
                    light and dark reaching the back of our eyes, and primarily
                    regulated by a structure in the brainâs hypothalamus region
                    called the master biological clock. (See Regulation of
                    circadian rhythms)

                    This master biological clock interacts with and regulates a
                    complex network of biological clocks that are found in
                    almost all tissue and every organ in the body. Each clock
                    has its own rhythmicity and responsibility for generating
                    and regulating the timing of its own circadian rhythm on
                    cues from the master clock (50, 51). Feeding and fasting,
                    body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, kidney
                    function, immune system functions, and body temperature are
                    just a few examples of the circadian rhythms regulated by
                    these biological clocks. And the light received by our eyesâ
                    retinas is the primary stimulus that makes everything tick
                    at the right time (52).

                    Why do circadian rhythms even need to be regulated? In the
                    absence of external or exogenous cues or zeitgebers (German
                    zeit = time, geber = giver), human circadian rhythms
                    free-run on a perpetually repeating cycle that is slightly
                    longer than the solar day. These cycles run about 24.2 hours
                    on average, with extremes of as long as 1-hour on either
                    side of that average depending on individual differences
                    between people (53).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over time, without timing cues provided by the light and
                    dark patterns of the daily solar cycle received at the eyes,
                    our circadian rhythms and bodily processes would eventually
                    cycle out of sync with the local time of our variable,
                    seasonal environment. We would go to bed later and wake up
                    later, have difficulty getting to work on time and feeling
                    alert once we got there, become hungry outside regular
                    mealtimes, and feel fatigue in after-work social situations.
                    In other words, we would tend to experience the common
                    things of everyday life at the wrong time of day relative to
                    our work schedules, social and family commitments, and
                    biological needs.

                    Scientists who study circadian rhythms â known as
                    chronobiologists â measure the timing of our bodiesâ
                    cyclical processes, which can be tracked, for example, by
                    monitoring the bodyâs release of hormones like melatonin or
                    cortisol. When our circadian rhythms cycle on a later
                    schedule than they should, as indicated by the later timing
                    of the bodyâs release of nighttime production of melatonin,
                    for example, our circadian rhythms are said to be delayed.
                    In this case, we tend to fall asleep later in the evening or
                    into the early morning and wake up later. Conversely, when
                    our circadian rhythms cycle on an earlier schedule than
                    normal, leading us to fall asleep and wake up earlier, our
                    circadian rhythms are said to be advanced. (See 3.1
                    Hormones, sleep, and alertness.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Depending on the time of day and the characteristics of any
                    light exposures that we might encounter, light can either
                    delay or advance the timing of our circadian rhythms (see
                    Light and the circadian system). This is basically what
                    happens when we cross multiple time zones and experience jet
                    lag, which becomes pronounced as we grow older and when
                    traveling east (54). Regardless of the direction traveled,
                    with the new destination comes a different schedule of light
                    and dark that is at odds with the one we left at home,
                    running either a few or even many hours too early or too
                    late.

                  <p>
                    Jet lag results in disturbed sleep and daytime fatigue,
                    generalized feelings of being under the weather, and
                    difficulty in concentrating because our circadian systems
                    have not yet adjusted to the new environment (55). But those
                    symptoms gradually subside as our circadian system becomes
                    synchronized or entrained to the new local environment by
                    adapting to our destinationâs local solar cycle. Social
                    activities and shift work that might fall outside the
                    regular sleep/wake cycle, producing a similar effect, are
                    known to chronobiologists as social jet lag (56) and shift
                    work disorder (14, 57) (see Circadian entrainment and
                    disruption).

                      Conditions that can come with altering the habitual
                      sleep/wake cycle. (Habitual sleep times are shaded red and
                      altered sleep times are shaded gray.). Jet lag resulting
                      from transmeridian travel (top) is most pronounced when
                      traveling east, simply because it is generally easier for
                      humans to fall asleep later (as when traveling west) than
                      their usual bedtime compared to an earlier bedtime. As a
                      result, travelers can feel energized when everyone else is
                      sleepy, but lethargic when everyone else is raring and
                      ready to go. The effects of social jet lag (middle) can
                      resemble those of westward travel, with its later weekend
                      bedtimes and wake times, but the return to work on Monday
                      after a weekend of late nights can feel like a non-stop
                      overnight flight back east. <br /><br />

                      Effects resembling jet lag that can accompany shift work,
                      when they become chronic, are attributed to shift work
                      disorder. This condition can lead to alertness during the
                      daytime sleep period, drowsiness at work, and compromised
                      job performance among those who work through the night.
                      These ill effects pose increased risk for those employed
                      in the healthcare and transportation sectors as well as
                      those who are in their care (see Light, sleep, and
                      alertness).<br /><br />

                      The good news? The master biological clock can adjust to
                      jet lag by gradually entraining our circadian rhythms to
                      the new schedule. Adjustments to shift work can be more
                      challenging, but the tips provided in Lighting
                      applications can help!

                      or dim?â)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The spectral properties of the light experienced, either
                      short-wavelength (âcoolâ or âbluishâ) or long-wavelength
                      (âwarmâ or âreddishâ) light
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The timing and duration of light exposures (âwhen, and for
                      how long?â)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A personâs cumulative history of light exposures (âhow
                      much, what spectra, and when over the past 24 hours?â).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    These lighting characteristics work together to affect the
                    circadian system, either entraining or desynchronizing our
                    circadian rhythms. For example, healthy people who follow
                    typical daytime work schedules require high levels (amount)
                    of short-wavelength (spectrum) light for at least 30 minutes
                    (duration) in the morning (timing) to promote circadian
                    entrainment, followed by exposure low levels (amount) of
                    long-wavelength (spectrum) light in the evening (timing).
                    This consistent daily pattern of light exposures (history)
                    promotes regular bedtimes, good quality sleep, and optimal
                    wake times for the day ahead. Due to various factors such as
                    age, individual differences between people, and varying
                    long-term histories of light exposure (e.g., permanent
                    night-shift workers or ânight owlâ chronotypes), people can
                    be differentially sensitive to light and thus will have
                    differential responses.

                    While these variable factors preclude a âone-size-fits-allâ
                    lighting prescription for circadian entrainment and health,
                    this web resource provides some useful general guidelines

                    The human master biological clock (SCN) in the hypothalamus
                    is activated when light received by the retinas is converted
                    into neural (i.e., electrochemical) signals in a process
                    known as circadian phototransduction, which employs a photic
                    neural pathway known as the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT)
                    that extends from the retinas to the SCN. The retinal cells
                    involved in phototransduction include the well-known rod and
                    cone photoreceptors as well as the intrinsically
                    photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which were
                    identified only at the turn of this century (58-60). Working
                    largely independently of image formation, the ipRGCs have
                    been documented to be active even in totally visually blind
                    animals and humans (61, 62).

                      (63), which in turn signals (upward red arrow) the pineal
                      gland to begin releasing the hormone.

                    Well-timed and carefully specified light exposures can
                    promote the entrainment of our circadian systems (see Light
                    and the circadian system). Exposure to light at the wrong
                    time, or not receiving enough light at the right time, has
                    become increasingly common since the advent of electrical
                    lighting over a century ago. Exposure to light at night
                    (LAN), and even a complete reversal of the dayânight pattern
                    in the case of night-shift workers, have become facts of
                    life in our 24-hour society. Exposure to LAN and
                    insufficient exposure to light early in the day has been
                    linked with disruption of the circadian system (64).
                    Long-term disruption of the daily cycle of light and dark
                    can lead to chronic disruption of the circadian system,
                    which has been associated with metabolic (leading to weight
                    gain, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) and cardiometabolic
                    dysregulation, certain forms of cancer, depression, and
                    other maladies (10, 65, 66). Although the precise reasons
                    for this association are not yet clear, a growing body of
                    research suggests that this disruption might be related to
                    lighting conditions in the built environment and irregular
                    exposures to daylight associated with our around-the-clock
                    lifestyle.

                    Compared to regular daytime workers, nurses who work during
                    or through the night have very different needs that depend
                    on how they choose to adjust to their work schedules. As
                    detailed in Applications: Lighting for alertness,
                    performance, and health, some consider it desirable to adapt
                    to a nighttime schedule by becoming more or less nocturnal,
                    whereas others prefer to maintain an adjusted diurnal
                    schedule that permits them to engage in family, social, and
                    community activities. Whatever path is chosen, those working
                    at night need to regulate their exposure to high levels of
                    light while at work, especially blue light, while also being
                    careful to receive sufficient light to promote alertness and
                    perform specific critical visual tasks like inserting an IV
                    cannula.

                    Scientists at the Lighting Research Center (LRC) at
                    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have been exploring the
                    role that light plays in synchronizing the circadian system,
                    and how exposures to the right kind of light at the right
                    time can help to avoid these negative outcomes. Our research
                    to date among diverse populations such as office workers,
                    submariners, and older adults with Alzheimerâs disease
                    suggests that appropriately timed, tailored lighting can
                    improve measures of alertness, depression, mood, and
                    feelings of vitality. The research funded by this project
                    (NIOSH 5R01OH010668-03) indicates that similar lighting
                    solutions can also be applied to shift-working healthcare
                    personnel (see Red light: A novel, non-pharmacological
                    intervention to promote alertness in shift workers).

                    Light is not just for vision and stimulating the circadian
                    system. Light also exerts an acute alerting effect on humans
                    that is similar to the boost provided by a cup of coffee.
                    Yet as we already know from Light and circadian rhythms,
                    lightâs alerting effect can come at a cost to circadian
                    entrainment, especially when experienced at the times we
                    might need it the most, like night shift. Depending on the
                    amount, spectral properties, and our history of exposure,
                    light at the wrong time can also disrupt our circadian
                    system and thereby threaten our health and well-being.

                    The human bodyâs central nervous and endocrine systems
                    transmit information throughout the body to regulate all
                    bodily functions. The nervous system is essentially a
                    hard-wired network made up of over 100,000 million nerve
                    cells that instantaneously transmit electrical signals from
                    the bodyâs peripheral nervous system and the outside world
                    to the central nervous system (i.e., the spinal cord to the
                    brain), which in turn dispatches electrical signals to
                    direct the actions of the bodyâs muscles, organs, and
                    tissues. The more slowly responding endocrine system, on the
                    other hand, sends chemical signals through the bloodstream
                    in the form of hormones excreted by the bodyâs endocrine
                    glands to regulate various processes (e.g., heart rate,
                    blood pressure, appetite, body temperature), including the
                    sleep/wake cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As discussed in Light and the circadian system, the
                    secretion of the hormones melatonin and cortisol both follow
                    circadian rhythms that are regulated by inputs from the
                    master biological clock based on cues provided by the
                    patterns of light and dark received at the retinae (67).
                    Melatonin, known as the âdarkness hormoneâ because it is
                    released at night and under conditions of darkness, is
                    produced by the pineal gland. In diurnal (i.e.,
                    daytime-active) species, melatonin signals to the body that
                    it is time for sleep (68). The concentration of melatonin in
                    the bloodstream begins to diminish in the latter hours of
                    sleep and after waking remains barely detectable throughout
                    the day.

                    Cortisol, produced by the adrenal glands, promotes the
                    synthesis and storage of glucose and influences metabolic,
                    immune, muscle, and functions (69) as well as various brain
                    activities as cognitive function (70) and the regulation of
                    emotions (71). In humans, cortisol remains in low
                    concentration in the bloodstream throughout the day but
                    gradually elevates throughout the night, culminating 30â45
                    minutes after waking in a sharp increase known as the
                    cortisol awakening response (72, 73). Although our
                    understanding of cortisol and its response to light are not
                    as well understood as that of melatonin (74, 75), it has
                    been speculated that the cortisol awakening response
                    promotes alertness and arousal in anticipation of the
                    forthcoming dayâs demands (76-78).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The effects of light on alertness at night are well
                    documented (79-82) and have been associated with lightâs
                    ability to suppress melatonin (83), particularly when the
                    source is short-wavelength (âcoolâ or âbluishâ) light that
                    matches the 460-nm peak spectral sensitivity of the human
                    circadian system (84-86). Studies using the kind of white
                    light typically found in workplaces have shown that very
                    high light levels (> 2500 lux compared to about 200 lux
                    during the daytime in hospital corridors) are needed to
                    promote subjectively and objectively assessed measures of
                    alertness (see Light, alertness, and task performance). On
                    the other hand, much lower levels (40 lux) of
                    short-wavelength light can produce a similar alerting effect
                    (86-88). These studies suggest that melatonin suppression
                    may play a role in alertness by âfooling the bodyâ into
                    thinking that it is daytime and therefore time to be awake
                    and alert.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thereâs a catch, though. Studies examining lightâs effects
                    on alertness have also been conducted during the daytime,
                    when the bodyâs melatonin levels are so low the hormone is
                    virtually absent (89-91). These studies are supported by
                    pioneering studies measuring brain activity (via functional
                    magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) in response to light,
                    finding that both bright (> 7000 lux) white light and lower
                    levels (7.5 lux) of short-wavelength (peak close to 473 nm)
                    light more effectively activated brain regions associated
                    with alertness compared to dim light or higher levels (24.5
                    lux) of middle-wavelength (peak close to 527-nm) light (92,
                    93). These and other studies suggest that melatonin
                    suppression is indeed not required to elicit alertness (94,
                    95).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Clearly, it appears that processes other than melatonin
                    suppression are involved in lightâs alerting effect, and
                    that those processes are instantaneous and probably related
                    to the central nervous system rather than just the more

                    Central to the work performed under our NIOSH grant, a new
                    line of study has shown that long-wavelength (peak close to
                    630 nm) âwarmâ or âredâ light can elicit alertness, both
                    night (47, 97) and day (88, 98). A key benefit of using red
                    light to promote workplace alertness, especially among
                    personnel who work irregular schedules involving nighttime
                    hours, is that red lightâs peak wavelength (close to 630 nm)
                    does not overlap with the peak spectral sensitivity of the
                    circadian system. In other words, red light can promote
                    alertness with no ill effects on circadian rhythms and, by
                    extension, workersâ sleep, heath, and general well-being.

                    The circadian systemâs master biological clock helps to
                    regulate the sleepâwake cycle in tandem with a process known
                    as sleep homeostasis (99-102) that maintains a constant
                    balance between sleep and wakefulness. The circadian system
                    essentially regulates the timing of sleep while homeostasis
                    regulates the need or pressure for sleep, in what has been
                    conceptualized by sleep scientists as a two-process model
                    (102, 103). Following what chronobiologists call Process C,
                    the circadian system promotes the timing of sleep at roughly
                    the same time every day and orchestrates physiological
                    process like the secretion of melatonin (see Light and
                    circadian rhythms). Sleep homeostasis follows Process S,
                    which builds pressure for sleep during waking hours and
                    dissipates pressure when we sleep, even if only during a
                    short afternoon nap. The interplay between these two systems
                    has been characterized by one sleep researcher as a
                    competition, with the âwinnerâ determining whether we are
                    awake or asleep (104). Experiments using animals whose
                    circadian rhythms have been disrupted by surgical lesions on
                    the SCN (i.e., the master biological clock ) have shown that
                    Process S is not affected, suggesting that the two processes
                    are independently regulated despite whatever âcrosstalkâ
                    might occur between them (105).

                    The workings of the two-process sleep model should be
                    familiar to anyone who has experienced sleepiness during the
                    conventional workday. Around 2â4 PM, or 16â18 hours after
                    the previous nightâs bedtime, many people experience a
                    decline in alertness and performance known as the post-lunch
                    dip (106). At this time of day, Process C cannot completely
                    counteract Process S, which is gathering momentum prior to
                    its abrupt peak and decline about 8 hours later. Process C
                    reaches its peak early evening (also known as wake
                    maintenance zone), when falling asleep is very difficult
                    (some refer this time as their âsecond waveâ). After
                    levelling off and reaching its peak, Process C switches and
                    resumes sending the body a sleeping signal. Combined with
                    the high amount of sleep debt accumulated by Process S
                    throughout the day, Process C finally triggers sleep. (The
                    LRC has innovated a unique application for getting us
                    through the post-lunch dip by using light to promote acute
                    alertness; see Lighting applications).

                    Important for the purpose of this website, light also has
                    dynamic relationships with alertness, sleepiness, and the
                    sleepâwake cycle. As noted, light elicits an acute alerting
                    response both day and night, in which âacuteâ denotes a
                    rapidly occurring, temporary effect that is more or less
                    independent of the circadian system and does not necessarily
                    influence the circadian systemâs timing (107). On the other
                    hand, light can also influence the timing of sleepâwake
                    Process C. Receiving light of a particular spectrum
                    (especially short-wavelength light) in sufficient levels for
                    a sufficient duration and a particular time of day can
                    affect the timing of when we sleep, which if experienced for
                    a sustained period of days or weeks can lead to circadian
                    disruption and its negative consequences (see Circadian
                    entrainment and disruption).

                    Alertness and sleepiness are like two sides of the same
                    coin, each with its own distinct domain. In diurnal species,
                    alertness is strongly associated with the daytime as well
                    high levels of environmental awareness (97) and high levels
                    of sensitivity to external stimuli (108), whereas sleepiness
                    is generally associated with the nighttime and inverse
                    levels of both states. This association creates obvious
                    problems for those who work through the night.

                  <p>
                    For experimental purposes, alertness and sleepiness are also
                    measured using complementary methods such as subjective
                    measures (e.g., self-reports like the Karolinska Sleepiness
                    [KSS] scale (109) and Subjective Vitality Scale (110));
                    objective measures of task performance in attention (e.g.,
                    Psychomotor Vigilance Task (111)) versus executive function
                    (e.g., Sustained Attention to Response task (112) and N-back
                    task (113)), and objective physiological outcomes (e.g.,
                    brain activity measured via electroencephalography [EEG]).

                  <p>
                    These outcomes have been used to assess lightâs alerting
                    effects in a broad range of studies whose findings have
                    significant practical applications for healthcare personnel
                    who work through the night. Studies to date, however, have
                    mainly focused on the acute alerting effects of light in
                    daytime workers, particularly with respect to providing
                    daylight in workplaces.

                      New research shows that long-wavelength (peak close to 630
                      nm) âredâ light can also promote alertness, both night and

                    Scientists at the Lighting Research Center (LRC) have been
                    actively researching lightâs effects on alertness,
                    performance, and human health since the centerâs inception
                    in 1988, exploring these effects and practical solutions for
                    improving the lives of diverse populations. In the course of
                    this research, the LRC has developed the circadian stimulus
                    (CS) (118-120) metric, which is based on the spectral
                    sensitivity of the retinal phototransduction mechanisms
                    stimulating the response of the master biological clock (see
                    Circadian entrainment and disruption). The basics of CS are
                    explained in the LRCâs freely available online video series.

                  <p>
                    Based on nocturnal melatonin suppression after a 1-hour
                    exposure to light, CS is expressed on a relative scale from
                    a threshold value of 0.1 (about 10% melatonin suppression),
                    indicating minimal stimulus of the circadian system, to a
                    maximum saturation value of 0.7 (about 70% melatonin
                    suppression), indicating maximal stimulus. In other words,
                    the higher the CS value, the greater a light sourceâs effect
                    on the circadian system. (More information on this topic can
                    be found at the Lighting for Healthy Living website, which
                    provides detailed information on lighting design suggestions
                    for healthcare personnel, patients, and visitors in its
                    background section.) For detailed information on the CS
                    metric and how the CS levels can be calculated in the built
                    environment, please feel free to refer to the LRCâs freely
                    available online CS Calculator.

                      Melatonin suppression and CS values calculated for
                      selected daylight and incandescent light levels. CS values
                      represent a transformation of circadian light (CLA), or
                      irradiance weighted by the spectral sensitivity of the
                      retinal phototransduction mechanisms stimulating the
                      response of the biological clock (solid black line), based
                      on nocturnal melatonin suppression after a 1-hour exposure
                      to light. CS is expressed as a relative scale from
                      approximately 0.1 (â 10%), the threshold for circadian
                      system activation, to approximately 0.7 (â 70%), response
                      saturation.

                    If the CS metric sounds overly technical and beyond the
                    reach of the average person, it certainly doesnât need to
                    get in the way of busy non-experts who are interested in
                    using light to promote workplace alertness, health, and
                    well-being. Fortunately, there are also much more
                    straightforward rules of thumb for managing light exposures
                    while working shifts, which are explored below.

                    Although the lighting requirements of hospital work (e.g.,
                    visibility and alertness for task performance) remain
                    constant around the clock, the needs of healthcare workers
                    themselves can vary widely throughout the day. It is
                    therefore important that frontline 24-hour workers like
                    nurses be mindful of making adjustments to their lighted
                    environment, wherever and whenever possible, to balance the
                    needs of the tasks at hand and those of their circadian
                    systems.

                    Of the four characteristics of light affecting the circadian
                    system (see Light and the circadian system), it is perhaps
                    easiest to adjust both the timing and duration and the
                    personal history of our 24-hour light exposures. This is
                    especially relevant for those working day shifts, who have
                    greater control over their nighttime lighted environment and
                    can take the following steps to achieve circadian
                    entrainment and it benefits (improved sleep, alertness,
                    mood):
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Sit next to an unshaded window to receive daylight soon
                      after waking for at about 30â60 minutes in the morning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Aim for high levels of light (> 300 lux at the eye)
                      through the early and mid-day by using a supplemental
                      lighting device (see below) or seeking daylight from
                      windows whenever possible.

                    <li>
                      Spend time outdoors on your lunch break, if possible, even
                      going for a brief walk if you have time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Minimize exposure to high levels of light (> 30 lux) in
                      the evening (2 hours prior to bedtime) and through the
                      night by dimming your bedroom and bathroom vanity
                      lighting. Use lowly positioned nightlights to illuminate
                      the floor line and doorways between your bedroom,
                      bathroom, and kitchen for nighttime navigation.

                    <li>
                      Avoid exposure to self-luminous electronic devices (e.g.,
                      cellphones, tablet computers, etc.) in the evening, at
                      least 2 hours prior to bedtime.

                    <li>
                      Avoid excessive outdoor exposure to daylight during the
                      late afternoon and early evening in the summer months, or
                      wear orange-tinted eyeglasses that filter out
                      short-wavelength âblueâ light (> 525 nanometers).

                    When at work, it is generally much more difficult for
                    individuals, especially nurses, to adjust the remaining two
                    characteristics of light affecting the circadian system (see
                    Light and the circadian system), amount and spectrum,
                    because they have far less control over their workplaceâs
                    nighttime lighted environment. This is largely because
                    strict lighting specifications with respect to amount (or
                    light levels) are recommended for hospitals and healthcare
                    facilities by organizations like the Illuminating
                    Engineering Society (121), and few if any choices with
                    respect spectrum are available in most facility-wide
                    lighting systems.

                  <p>
                    For these reasons, the LRC recommends adopting a portable
                    personalized lighting approach, specifically when aiming to
                    promote and circadian entrainment while avoiding circadian
                    system disruption. While not yet widely available as viable
                    commercial products, new technologies using desktop
                    luminaires (i.e., lamps) and wearable light goggles emitting
                    blue, white, or red light hold great promise. Broad
                    guidelines for their use are provided in the table below.

                    Hospitals provide around-the-clock patient care, compelling
                    health care professionals to work evening, overnight, and
                    rotating shifts. The demands of this 24-hour work schedule
                    are inherently out of sync and conflict with workersâ
                    physiological demands as well as their social and family
                    commitments, which can interfere with alertness and
                    circadian entrainment and thereby compromise worker safety,

                    Prior to making any decisions about their personal 24-hour
                    lighted environment, shift workers first have to assess
                    their work schedule and then decide how they plan to adapt
                    to it, asking questions like:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b><i>How long does the shift schedule run?</i></b>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Only two or three consecutive night shifts, for
                          example, would minimize the number of days spent in a
                          desynchronized state per week (122).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A greater number of consecutive shifts, on the other
                          hand, would provide workers with increased opportunity
                          to become better entrained to their work schedule
                          (123).
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Working longer shifts (10â12 hours) or overtime shifts
                          (as many as 16 hours) will maximize workersâ time off
                          the job, perhaps making entrainment to the night shift
                          unnecessary.

                          Evidence shows that taking naps while working can
                          reduce subjective sleepiness (124) and promote
                          alertness (125, 126), though caution must be taken to
                          counter the effects of temporary sleepiness (known as
                          sleep inertia) after waking (127, 128).

                          of objectively assessed alertness, especially when
                          combined with caffeine (131).

                          It depends. If you are not a permanent night worker,
                          aligning the sleep cycle to their time off provides
                          workers with greater opportunities to fulfill their
                          social and family commitments. On the other hand, it
                          will certainly be harder to stay awake during the
                          night shift.

                    Depending on how you have resolved these questions, a few
                    key lighting principles are important to remember:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Maintaining a regular, robust 24-hour pattern of light and
                      dark at the eyes is crucial for circadian entrainment and
                      its attendant benefits, whether at work or rest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While high light levels (i.e., amounts) promote alertness
                      at any time of day or night, that same light can also
                      stimulate the circadian system, so it is desirable to
                      weigh alertness against the benefits or detriments of
                      receiving circadian stimulus at any given time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Because the circadian system is maximally sensitive to
                      short-wavelength (blue) light, even low levels (e.g., 30
                      lux at the eyes) of a saturated blue light can deliver
                      more CS than much higher levels (300 lux at the eyes) of
                      cool white (4000 K) light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Blue or bright light is generally desirable early in the
                      daytime, but can disrupt the circadian system if
                      experienced at night.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stimulating the circadian system with blue or high levels
                      of white light at night promotes alertness but also
                      suppresses the bodyâs production of melatonin (see
                      Circadian entrainment and disruption) and disrupts the
                      circadian system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The daytime sleep period following the night shift is
                      driven by sleep pressure (see Sleeping, waking, and acute
                      alertness) rather than our natural circadian rhythms
                      (e.g., melatonin levels) that cue the body to sleep at
                      night.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Avoiding or minimizing light stimulus (such as bright
                          morning light) during the commute home can make it
                          easier to fall asleep.

                          Drawing the window shades, or even installing blackout
                          shades, in living areas and your bedroom would also be
                          helpful.

                    Rotating shifts, especially when they follow three âturnsâ
                    (i.e., days, afternoon/evenings, and nights) that involve
                    working through the night, can be difficult to adapt to and
                    pose formidable challenges for circadian entrainment and
                    health (Shift work and health risks). Choosing whether to
                    adapt to the new weekâs work schedule or remain synchronized
                    to the day shift can also be problematic, because daytime
                    work is scheduled for every third shift turn rather than
                    every other shift turn. While it has long been thought that
                    rotating the three turns in clockwise order (i.e., days to
                    afternoon/evenings to nights) is preferable because delaying
                    sleep times is easier than advancing them (132), most
                    workers rarely have a direct say in the scheduling of shifts
                    (133).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given the high variability of rotating schedules, quickly
                    emerging contingencies (e.g., last-minute requests to work
                    overtime), and biological differences between individuals,
                    it is nearly impossible to specify facility-wide lighting
                    that will accommodate the precise needs of all workers.
                    Furthermore, as concluded in a recent review of 27 studies
                    exploring lighting interventions to improve circadian
                    adaptation to nighttime working hours, a lack of long-term
                    data on the health outcomes of these interventions precludes
                    making anything but broad recommendations (134). Fewer than
                    half of the studies were conducted in the field with workers
                    in real-world situations, only one field study included
                    workers transitioning between day and night shifts (with
                    non-significant objective results for the 30-minute bright
                    light [10,000 lux] intervention), and none were randomized,
                    controlled clinical trials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the techniques shown above for night-shift
                    workers (especially after the shift), some broad suggestions
                    for managing personal light exposures might be of interest
                    to rotating-shift workers. Those working rotating 12-hour
                    shifts, for example, should not attempt full adaptation to
                    the night shift, since both schedules permit daytime
                    functioning equally well and a day-shift schedule is more
                    compatible with personal and social commitments. Instead,
                    light exposures can be used to ease the transition between
                    schedules in preparation the upcoming shift sequence and
                    mitigate problems with sleep and alertness. For example, a
                    Norwegian study of night-shift oil rig workers found that
                    30-minute bright light (10,000 lux) exposures experienced at
                    2 PM on the first transition day to a day-shift
                    scheduleâfollowed by bright light exposures delayed at
                    2-hour intervals over succeeding daysâreduced workersâ
                    perception of the time required to re-adapt to day shift
                    (135). As indicated, however, more research on lighting
                    interventions for rotating-shift workers is needed before
                    precise light dosing specifications and schedules can be
                    recommended.

                      Maintaining a regular, robust 24-hour pattern of light and
                      dark at the eyes is crucial for circadian entrainment and
                      its attendant benefits, whether at work or rest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While high levels (i.e., amounts) of light promote
                      alertness at any time of day or night, that same light can
                      also stimulate the circadian system, so it is desirable to
                      weigh alertness against the benefits or detriments of
                      receiving circadian stimulus at any given time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Because the circadian system is maximally sensitive to
                      short-wavelength (blue) light, even low levels (e.g., 30
                      lux at the eyes) of a saturated blue light can deliver
                      more CS than much higher levels (300 lux at the eyes) of
                      cool white (4000 K) light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Blue light is generally desirable early in the daytime but
                      can be disrupt the circadian system if experienced at
                      night.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To promote alertness and avoid disrupting the circadian
                      system, red light (at least 100 lux at the eye) delivers
                      negligible CS (< 0.01) and can be used to provide an
                      alerting effect similar to a cup of coffee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Personal lighting devices can be used to deliver
                      appropriately timed blue or red light, independent of
                      facility-wide lighting systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      More field research is needed on the efficacy and
                      long-term effects of lighting interventions to improve
                      circadian adaptation to working hours.
